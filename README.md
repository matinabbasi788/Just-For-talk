this challenge for beginner programmers
======================================
I have an idea for you.
You need to develop a program that can answer a lot of questions and has a language learning aspect.
I did a little bit of it. You have to keep doing it and solve his problems so that he can have a good conversation somewhere.


I will be happy to send it to you after you do this.
 
The interesting thing about this is that everyone uses the words and texts they like, and that's great, but when you do that, you can, like me, put your idea into a program in any language as far as the idea goes. Write to others and publish it in your GitHub and mention this post in that post. Thankful
